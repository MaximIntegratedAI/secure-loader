Programming the MAX78000 with the Bootloader Firmware
To program the MAX78000 bootloader code into the MAX78000FTHR, use the following steps:
1.	Connect the micro-USB cable to the MAX78000FTHR and the PC.
2.	In the MinGWÂ® window that is created after double-clicking msys.bat in the C:\MaximSDK\Tools\MinGW\msys\1.0 directory, navigate to the demo directory by typing in the following command, which uses forward slashes:
cd c: /max78000_demo
3.	To flash the bootloader, type the following:
openocd -s $MAXIM_PATH/tools/OpenOCD/scripts -f interface/cmsis-dap.cfg -f target/max78000.cfg -c 'init ;halt;max32xxx mass_erase 0;program MAX78000_Bootloader_vx_x_x.bin verify reset exit 0x10000000'
